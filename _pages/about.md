I'm a second-year M.S.C.S student at UCLA. Before that, I obtained B.S. in computer science with a minor in mathematics at UCLA, graduating with Cum Laude standing. 

I am applying for Ph.D. program for Fall 2025 season. 

I enjoy skiing for my winter times. Check out my seasonal ski maps if you are interested.

If you are interested in research collaboration, feel free to contact me via email.

Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
