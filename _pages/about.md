I'm a second-year M.S.C.S student at UCLA. Before that, I obtained B.S. in computer science with a minor in mathematics at UCLA, graduating with Cum Laude standing. 

I am applying for Ph.D. program for Fall 2025 season. My research interests include embodied AI using foundation models and generative modeling. I have experience in end-to-end training of Vision-Language-Models as well as diffusion models, and I have also managed large-scale data. My most proficient programming language is Python, but I have made some frontend projects using JavaScript for research purpose. 


For leisure time, I am frentic about skiing, spending almost all my winter breaks in ski resorts for the past four years. Check out my seasonal ski maps (coming) if you are interested. I'm also into LEGO building and Gunpla building.

Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
